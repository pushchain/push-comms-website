# Trigger Notification Settings in Showrunners

This tutorial is intended to get you up and going by providing a step-by-step tutorial in integrating notification settings in the showrunners framework. Checkout [Showrunners Docs](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/showrunners-scaffold/get-started/), [Showrunners Framework](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-showrunners-framework/tree/main), [Channel Settings Docs](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/build/create-channel-settings/) and [Channel Settings Demo](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-showrunners-framework/tree/main/src/sample_showrunners/bank) for better understanding!

### Setup the Showrunners in your local machine

For detailed, step-by-step guide visit the Showrunners [docs](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/showrunners-scaffold/get-started/). First we need to create a folder in `src/showrunners/<your_channel_name>`

### Install Dependencies & start up

Navigate to the SDK directory and install required dependencies.

```bash
cd push-showrunners-framework
yarn install
docker-compose up
yarn run dev
```

### Import the Push SDK

After you have created a channel folder. Refer to Showrunners [docs](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/showrunners-scaffold/get-started/). Move to the [name]Channel.ts file and import the dependencies.

```jsx
import { CONSTANTS, PushAPI } from '@pushprotocol/restapi';
```

#### [Channel File](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/bank/bankChannel.ts)

In order to send notification, we need to have the instance of the user channel. To get that, we need to add the below function in our 'Channel class'
.

```jsx
async initializeUser() {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.WebSocketProvider(process.env.ALCHEMY_WEBSOCKET);
  const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractAbi, provider);

  const signer = new ethers.Wallet(
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, // Private key of the channel owner (or channel creation wallet)
      provider
  );

  // PushAPI.initialize(signer, {options?});
  // 'CONSTANTS.ENV.PROD' -> mainnet apps | 'CONSTANTS.ENV.STAGING' -> testnet apps
  const userAlice = await PushAPI.initialize(signer, { env: CONSTANTS.ENV.STAGING });

  return { contract, userAlice };
}
```

### Build the notification payload

Design your own payload with custom values in the when you want to trigger notifications. To learn more about notification settings, refer to [docs](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/build/create-channel-settings/)

```jsx
const payload = {
  notification: {
    title: 'Title',
    body: 'Notif Body',
  },
  payload: {
    title: 'Title',
    body: 'Payload body',
    cta: 'https://google.com/',
    embed: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64157541?s=200&v=4',
    // index of the notification the channel wants to trigger, in this for 1nd index which is for Boolean type
    category: 1, // Depending upon your use-case
  },
};
```

### Setup Notification trigger

We create a function that will send notifications depending upon the type. To get that, we need to add the below function in our 'Channel class'
.

```jsx
async sendThroughNotifSettings(userAlice, payload) {
  try {
    const notifRes = await userAlice.channel.send(['*'], payload);
    return notifRes;
  } catch (error) {
    this.logInfo("ERRORüî¥ from sendThroughNotifSettings: ", error);
  }
}
```

### How does it actually work?

The Showrunner framework listens to the on-chain events through web-sockets. According to events emitted, an user can create respective notifications and subscribers can opt-in as per their wish. The `send` function takes in an array of all the addresses eligible to receive notifications. In case of `*`, all the addresses subscribed to the channel is eligible for it. You can have a custom array of addresses as well. Furthermore, the `payload` contains `category` which specifies the notification category (as setup by the user). So in the above example all addresses who opted-in for `category-1` (bank holiday - boolean in this case), will receive the notification.

Summarizing the entire process, web-sockets listen to on-chain events and notifies the showrunners framework. Depending upon the array provided in the `send` function and the `category` provided in the `payload`, users opted in for the notification type, receives it.

You are all set to send notifications through the showrunners framework. Now, bundling up notification settings with web-sockets you can trigger custom notifications based on on-chain activities. Isn't this awesome?‚ú®
